## Suggested Further Work
If you have finished the tutorial up until this point, you could attempt one of
the following tasks:
* Run a forward simulation with a different model resolution
* Setup and run a simulation with an event of your choice
* Run a forward simulation with a different background model and compare the
  seismograms for the two simulations
