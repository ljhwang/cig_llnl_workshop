### SPECFEM3D_GLOBE <a name="specfem"></a>

"The software package SPECFEM3D_GLOBE simulates three-dimensional global and
regional seismic wave propagation and performs full waveform imaging (FWI) or
adjoint tomography based upon the spectral-element method (SEM). The SEM is a
continuous Galerkin technique (Tromp, Komatitsch, and Liu 2008; Peter et al.
2011), which can easily be made discontinuous (Bernardi, Maday, and Patera
1994; Chaljub 2000; Kopriva, Woodruff, and Hussaini 2002; Chaljub, Capdeville,
and Vilotte 2003; Legay, Wang, and Belytschko 2005; Kopriva 2006; Wilcox et al.
2010; Acosta Minolia and Kopriva 2011); it is then close to a particular case
of the discontinuous Galerkin technique (Reed and Hill 1973; Lesaint and
Raviart 1974; Arnold 1982; Johnson and Pitkäranta 1986; Bourdel, Mazet, and
Helluy 1991; Falk and Richter 1999; Hu, Hussaini, and Rasetarinera 1999;
Cockburn, Karniadakis, and Shu 2000; Giraldo, Hesthaven, and Warburton 2002;
Rivière and Wheeler 2003; Monk and Richter 2005; Grote, Schneebeli, and
Schötzau 2006; Ainsworth, Monk, and Muniz 2006; Bernacki, Lanteri, and Piperno
2006; Dumbser and Käser 2006; De Basabe, Sen, and Wheeler 2008; Puente,
Ampuero, and Käser 2009; Wilcox et al. 2010; De Basabe and Sen 2010; Étienne et
al. 2010), with optimized efficiency because of its tensorized basis functions
(Wilcox et al. 2010; Acosta Minolia and Kopriva 2011). In particular, it can
accurately handle very distorted mesh elements (Oliveira and Seriani 2011)."

### Napa Earthquake <a name="napa"></a>

"The 2014 South Napa earthquake occurred in the North San Francisco Bay Area on
August 24 at 03:20:44 Pacific Daylight Time. At 6.0 on the moment magnitude
scale and with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe) the event was the
largest in the San Francisco Bay Area since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. It
was located to the south of Napa and to the northwest of American Canyon on the
West Napa Fault. Total damage in the southern Napa Valley and Vallejo areas was
in the range of $362 million to 1 billion, with one person killed and 200
injured. Other aspects of the event included an experimental earthquake warning
system that alerted seismologists several seconds before the damaging shear
waves arrived, temporary changes in springs and wells, and the potential for
postseismic fault creep."
