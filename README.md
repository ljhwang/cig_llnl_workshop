## Overview

This tutorial will show you how to set up and run a continental-scale
simulation using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

The tutorial consists of four parts. In the first part, we will look at how to
set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. In part two, we use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run a
continental-scale simulation. In part three, we explore how to visualize the
output simulation data using ObsPy and Paraview, and in part four, we will look 
at how to run adjoint simulations using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.
