# Overview

This tutorial will show you how to set up and run a continental-scale
simulation using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

The tutorial consists of three parts. In the first part, we will look at how to
set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. In part two, we use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run a
continental-scale simulation. And in parth three, we explore some additional
topics, which includes visualization and how to use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run adjoint simulations.

The event that we will be focusing on in this tutorial is the 2014 [South Napa
earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_South_Napa_earthquake).


## Part I: Setting up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE: 

* Description: In the first part of the tutorial, we will go through the steps
  that are required to obtain the SPECFEM3D_GLOBE source code, and look at how
  to properly configure and compile it.

* Learning goals:
    * Understand the steps required to set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.
    * Get an idea of how to set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE in one's own environment.

## Part II: Continental-scale Simulations:
