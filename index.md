# Overview

In this tutorial we will use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run regional simulations. We
will focus on the 2014 Napa earthquake, and look at how to setup and configure
SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to simulate this event.

We will start from scratch and show you how to obtain the source code,
configure, and compile it. Then we will look at how to prepare the input data,
which includes the source characteristics, receiver locations, and other
parameters. Once the input parameters have been set, we go on to create a mesh
for our model, and then run the solver. The solver will produce some output
data and we will look at how to visualize these data.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of how to:
* Obtain and setup SPECFEM3D_GLOBE in your own environment.
* Run a simulation using an event of your own interest
* Change the resolution of the simulation
* Use different earth models
* Visualize the simulation output
