## Overview

This tutorial will show you how to set up and run a continental-scale
simulation using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

The tutorial consists of three parts. In the first part, we will look at how to
set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. In part two, we use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run a
continental-scale simulation. And in parth three, we explore some additional
topics, which includes visualization and how to use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run adjoint simulations.

The event that we will be focusing on in this tutorial is the 2014 [South Napa
earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_South_Napa_earthquake).


### Part I: Setting up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE: 

* **Description:** In the first part of the tutorial, we will go through the steps
  that are required to obtain the SPECFEM3D_GLOBE source code, and look at how
  to properly configure and compile it.

* **Learning goals:**
    * Understand the steps required to set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.
    * Get an idea of how to set up SPECFEM3D_GLOBE in your own environment.


### Part II: Continental-scale Simulations:

* **Description:** In the second part of the tutorial, we will look at how to prepare
  the input data for the continental-scale simulation. This includes providing
  the source characteristics, providing the station locations, and setting the
  simulation parameters. We will also go through how to mesh the model, and how
  to run the solver.

* **Learning goals:**
    * Understand the steps required to run a continental-scale simulation with SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.
    * Get an overview of what data must be set in order to run a simulation with SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.
    * Learn how to change the resolution of a simulation.
    * Get an idea of how to submit the mesh and solver job on the cluster.


### Part III: Additional Topics:

* **Description:** In part three, we will look at how to visualize the
  simulation output using Paraview. We will also expand our toolbox by looking
  at how we can use SPECFEM3D_GLOBE to run adjoint simulations.

* **Learning goals:**
    * Get an idea of how to visualize the simulation output.
    * Understand the steps required to run adjoint simulations using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.
