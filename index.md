# Overview

In this tutorial you will learn how to run a regional simulation using
SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

We will start from scratch, and show you how to obtain the source code,
configure, and compile SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. We will look at how to provide the
relevant input data, show you how to create a mesh for the regional model, and
how to run the solver itself.

For this tutorial, we will focus on the 2014 Napa earthquake for our regional
simulations.

### Tutorial at a glance:

**Introduction:** Short introduction about SPECFEM3D_GLOBE and the Napa
earthquake.

**Getting Started:** Shows you how to obtain the source code, configure, and
compile SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. It also shows you how to prepare the relevant input
data.

**Meshing:**



By the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of how to:
* Obtain and setup SPECFEM3D_GLOBE in your own environment.
* Run a simulation using an event of your own interest
* Change the resolution of the simulation
* Use different earth models
* Visualize the simulation output
