# Overview

In this tutorial you will learn how to run a regional simulation using
SPECFEM3D_GLOBE.

We will start from scratch, and show you how to obtain the source code,
configure, and compile SPECFEM3D_GLOBE. We will look at how to provide the
relevant input data, show you how to create a mesh for the regional model, and
how to run the solver itself.


For this tutorial, we will focus on the 2014 Napa earthquake for our regional
simulations.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of how to:
* Obtain and setup SPECFEM3D_GLOBE in your own environment.
* Run a simulation using an event of your own interest
* Change the resolution of the simulation
* Use different earth models
* Visualize the simulation output
